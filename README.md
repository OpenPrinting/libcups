> *Note:* This is a major release update of the CUPS library that breaks both
> binary and source compatibility with prior releases of CUPS.

The CUPS library (libcups) provides a common C API for HTTP/HTTPS and IPP
communications on Unix®-like operating systems and Microsoft Windows®.  It is
used by many printing-related projects such as [CUPS][CUPS] and [PAPPL][PAPPL].
This project is part of OpenPrinting's CUPS 3.0 development, which will provide
a 100% driverless printing system for Unix®-life operating systems.

This version of the CUPS library removes all of the deprecated and obsolete APIs
from CUPS 2.x and earlier and is *not* binary compatible with older releases.
See the file `doc/cupspm.html` for a description of the changes and how to
migrate your code to the new library.

The CUPS library is licensed under the Apache License Version 2.0 with an
exception to allow linking against GNU GPL2-only software.  See the files
`LICENSE` and `NOTICE` for more information.


Getting the Code
----------------

*Do not use the ZIP file available via the Github "Code" button on the main*
*project page, as that archive is missing the PDFio submodule and will not*
*compile.*

The source code is available in release tarballs or via the Github repository.
For a release tarball, run the following commands:

    tar xvzf libcups-VERSION.tar.gz
    cd libcups-VERSION

Similarly, the release ZIP file can be extracted with the following commands:

    unzip libcups-VERSION.zip
    cd libcups-VERSION

From the Github sources, clone the repository with the `--recurse-submodules`
option *or* use the `git submodule` commands:

    git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:OpenPrinting/libcups.git
    cd libcups

    git clone git@github.com:OpenPrinting/libcups.git
    cd libcups
    git submodule update --init --recursive

To update an already-cloned repository:

    git pull
    git submodule update --init --recursive
